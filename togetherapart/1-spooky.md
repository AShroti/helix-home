# Project Helix Get Together/Stay Apart I

## Spooky Season Edition

Oct 2020, Online

---

(See the [Archive](./README.md) for past Get Togethers and Stay Aparts â€“ there aren't any, this will be the first one)

We can't have any [Hackathons](../hackathons/README.md) this year, so we get together by staying apart in a six-hour virtual hangout session to chat, code, and snack.

### Organization

> I hear this is a replacement for a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

No. The main goal is to chat and socialize, any coding that will be done is a plus.

#### Date and Time

Still TBD

#### How it Works

1. Get a reasonably quiet place
2. Get separate screens for Bluejeans and your regular desktop
3. Join the BlueJeans session
4. Leave your microphone unmuted and camera on
5. Talk to anyone at any time
6. Use a breakout Bluejeans session for discussions and list it [below](#breakouts)
7. No recordings will be made
8. If you need a break, take a break

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

Remote Attendance Only

#### Breakouts

### Goal

> What are you planning to discuss during the day?

### Attendees

> Who is going to be there? Can I come?

1. @trieloff 

Everyone is invited.

### Preparation

> What can I do to prepare for the Stay Apart?

1. Read the `README.md` and linked vision documents in this repo
2. Join `#helix-chat` on Slack
3. Install the `hlx` Command Line app and create your first project
4. Comment on the GitHub issues you think would be good candidates for the Hackathon

### Food & Beverages

Stock up on snacks, drinks, and order food delivery so that we can eat together, apart.
