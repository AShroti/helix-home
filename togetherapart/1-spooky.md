# Project Helix Get Together/Stay Apart I

Spooky Season Edition — October 20, 2020, Online

---

> What's spookier than a black cat during a moonlit night? Being on call during a major Adobe event!

(See the [Archive](./README.md) for past Get Togethers and Stay Aparts – there aren't any, this will be the first one)

We can't have any [Hackathons](../hackathons/README.md) this year, so we get together by staying apart in a six-hour virtual hangout session to chat, code, and snack.

For the first Stay Apart, we selected the date and time of the Adobe MAX conference so that we can give emotional and actual support to the on-call team members on that day.

### Organization

> I hear this is a replacement for a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

No. The main goal is to chat and socialize, any coding that will be done is a plus.

#### Date and Time

October 20th, 2020, Online

- San Jose: 4 am to 10 am
- Basel: 1 pm to 7 pm
- Tokyo: 8 pm to 2 am

#### How it Works

1. Get a reasonably quiet place
2. Get separate screens for Bluejeans and your regular desktop
3. Join the BlueJeans session
4. Leave your microphone unmuted and camera on
5. Talk to anyone at any time
6. Use a breakout Bluejeans session for discussions and list it [below](#breakouts)
7. No recordings will be made
8. If you need a break, take a break

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

### Goal

> What are you planning to discuss during the day?

Put down the topic and the people that would like to discuss it:

* operationalizing breaking changes @trieloff @tripodsan

2. Join `#helix-chat` on Slack
3. Install the `hlx` Command Line app and create your first project
4. Comment on the GitHub issues you think would be good candidates for the Hackathon

### Food & Beverages

Stock up on snacks, drinks, and order food delivery so that we can eat together, apart.
