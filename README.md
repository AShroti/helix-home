## Manifesto


### Open Meritocracy
We will work as meritocracy, input from others, and reviewing PRs and contributing to other projects it a top priority.

### Open Source

### Diversity
We are a diverse team in every respect.

### APIs first
Everything has an API, of course.

### Serverless
period.

### Local Development
Support for simple local development is imperative. Low entry barrier.

### CI/CD
Push to production often and small.

### JavaScript and Python
On the server-side JavaScript and Python are used for the respectively intuitive payloads.

### More code, less blah, blah
Code wins. Everybody codes. Commits.

### Slack, GitHub issues, email archive
