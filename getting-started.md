# Getting Started with Helix

This page demonstrates how to develop a website from scratch with Helix and deploy it in production.

## Develop your Helix Site

### Pre-Requisites

1. Node 8 (or later) and corresponding `npm` 

2. `git` & [GitHub](https://github.com) account

3. [Install](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/blob/master/README.md#installation) Helix Client

### Initialize your new project with sample code

Run:

```bash
hlx demo mytestproject
cd mytestproject
```

The `mytestproject` folder contains everything you need to start "coding" your website. Main entry point is the HTL template `src/html.htl` that defines the HTML of your webpages.

While Helix supports a pure local developement code base, it could be a good idea to set the `git remote`, the place where you will store your code.

* Go to [http://github.com/](http://github.com/) and create a new `mytestprojectcode` repository in your favorite org.
* Add the remote locally:

```bash
git remote add origin <mytestprojectcode_git_repo_url>
```
(Make sure your GithUb URL ends with `.git`)

You can then commit and push your code.

### Develop locally

Run:

```bash
hlx up
```

Open the url [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

A default page is rendered. You can change the HTL template `src/html.htl` and reload the page, changes will be automatically applied.

### Where is the content?

#### Local content
During the project init, one file has been created locally: `index.md`. You can change the content and reload the page, changes will be automatically applied. You can create more files, like a `test.md` and request [http://localhost:3000/test.html](http://localhost:3000/test.html) to see the content.

This is really useful for local and offline development but this is not where the content should reside.

#### Content stored on GitHub

* Go to [http://github.com/](http://github.com/) and create a new `mytestprojectcontent` repository in your favorite org. Add an `index.md` file in there.
* In mytestproject, edit the `helix-config.yaml`: uncomment the `content` property and add your repository URL.
* Restart `hlx up`

Open the url [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/): the content is now coming from the `mytestprojectcontent` GitHub repository.

## Deploy your Helix Site

### Pre-requisites

1. Get [access](https://github.com/adobe/project-helix/blob/master/SERVICES.md#adobe-io-runtime) to Adobe I/O Runtine.
2. Get [access](https://github.com/adobe/project-helix/blob/master/SERVICES.md#fastly) to Fastly.
3. Install `wsk`
    1. `brew install wsk` (or [download](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-cli/releases) and install OpenWhisk-client manually)
    2. `wsk property set --apihost runtime.adobe.io --auth <wsk_auth> --namespace <wsk_namespace>`

### Fastly Setup

#### Onboarding a Domain

1. Log in to https://manage.fastly.com/account/tls/domains
2. Click "create TLS domain" https://manage.fastly.com/account/tls/domains/new
3. Enter the domain name with a wildcard qualifier: e.g. `*.experience-adobe.com`
4. Click next
5. In the list of domains, click "verify" next to your new domain name
6. Copy the `TXT` record and set it as a new DNS record (for `@`)
7. Be patient, as DNS propagation can take an hour
8. Click verify

#### Creating a Service

1. Log in to https://manage.fastly.com/services/all
2. Click "create service" or go to https://manage.fastly.com/configure/services/new
3. Enter name for the service, e.g. `helix-demo.xyz`
4. Enter the domain, using the wildcard qualifier, e.g. `*.helix-demo.xyz` (this allows you to easily map subdomains to strains)
5. Enter `example.com` for "Address" â€“ this field will be overridden later on
6. Click "no, do not verify my TLS certificate"
7. Click "create"
8. Copy and remember the service ID


### Go Live

#### Build and deploy the action

Run:

```bash
hlx build
hlx deploy --wsk-namespace <your_openwisk_namespace> --wsk-auth <your_openwisk_auth>
```

`--dirty` might be needed if you have local changes, which in theory should not be the case for a "go live".

This deploys your code to Adobe I/O Runtime. The action name should be something like `local--mytestproject--html` if you do not have set a GitHub remote url, or `/<your_openwisk_namespace>/<mytestprojectcode-git-url-dash-encoded>--html` if set.

Useful debugging commands:

```bash
wsk action list # check if you command is in your namespace

wsk activation poll # show action activation logs
```

#### Test the function

This is purely for debugging purposes and checking the internals.

Invoke the action:

```
wsk action invoke -r --blocking <mytestprojectcode-git-url-dash-encoded>--html -p owner <your_org> -p repo mytestprojectcontent -p ref master -p path /index.md
```

This should return the rendered HTML.

Test with URL:

```bash
 wsk action get --url /<your_openwisk_namespace>/<mytestprojectcode-git-url-dash-encoded>--html
```

This outputs a URL that you can paste in your browser and add some few extra request parameters: `https://runtime.adobe.io/api/v1/web/<your_openwisk_namespace>/default/<mytestprojectcode-git-url-dash-encoded>--html?owner=<your_org>&repo=mytestprojectcontent&ref=master&path=/index.md`

Note:
  * The `owner`, `repo`, `ref` and `path` parameters refer to the content repository. You can create a new md file in the repo, change the `path` in the request and load the url: it will render this other page. Or try another ref (branch, tag or commit id)
  * Running `wsk activation poll` in a terminal should show you some logs of the rendering process (action activation)

#### Publish

Run:

```bash
hlx publish --wsk-namespace <your_openwisk_namespace> --wsk-auth <your_openwisk_auth> --fastly-namespace <your_fastly_namespace> --fastly-auth <your_fastly_service_id>
```

Open https://<your_domain>/ in the browser: your site is live!

#### Debug

Run:

```bash
curl -v -H "X-Debug: true" https://<your_domain>/
```
