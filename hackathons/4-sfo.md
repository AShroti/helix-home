## (Upcoming) Forth Project Helix Hackathon

The fourth Project Helix Hackathon will happen in the week of January 28th to February 1st, i.e. just before Adobe Tech Summit.

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?
