# Project Helix Hackathon X

November 28th to December 2nd 2022, Southern Europe (exact location TBD).

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Hackathons)

With more than 2 years in solitude, [one canceled hackathon](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/blob/main/hackathons/9-bcn.md), and the memory of the 
[Palm Springs Hackathon](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/blob/main/hackathons/8-psp.md) rapidly fading, we want to try something new: **meeting in person**.

As we have been out of practice for quite some time we will need some more lead time to secure time, location, and travel budget from an organization
and team that has grown used to staying mostly in place. 

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on stuff that won't
fit neatly into a 45-minute teams meeting.

| Time      | Monday                     | Tuesday                          | Wednesday   | Thursday    | Friday                   |
| --------: | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |

| Afternoon | Airport Transfer & Arrival | Software Engineering             | Coding      | Coding      | Team lunch and departure |
|   Evening | Set-up, drinks             | Fiddling with Code               | Hacking     | Team dinner | -                        |

#### Remote Attendance

We will accomodate remote attendance for select sessions only, the main event is in person.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

We don't know yet, but will find a great place to meet in a location that is reasonably reachable for the majority of participants. Details to follow.
