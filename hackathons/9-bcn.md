# Project Helix Hackathon IX
Apr 2020, Barcelona, Spain (exact date TBD)

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Hackathons)

The ninth Project Helix Hackathon will happen sometime during the last two weeks of April. It is still a few days out, but as space is limited, we ask you to register as soon as possible.

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

We do have the hotel from **Sunday** to Friday, so if you can accommodate, I recommend to fly in on Sunday.

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.
