# Project Helix Show & Tell I

## The Pumpkin Spice Show & Tell

Oct 27th 2020, 9 AM PT, Online

---

(See the [Archive](./README.md) for past Show & Tells â€“ there aren't any, this will be the first one)

Project Helix Show & Tells are on ongoing series of web meetings where Helix Pages users share the sites they have built with Helix, share feedback and inspiration with other users, and get tips & tricks from Project Helix developers.

### How it Works

> How will this work?

There will be three to four presenters for each show & tell. Presenters don't need slides, just a screen share of their site and a link to their GitHub repository.

Each presentation will take between 7 and 10 minutes, followed by 7 to 10 minutes of discussion.

The session will be recorded and shared here.
