# The Helix Manifesto

The Helix PACT is:

* **P**roduct Experience `#p`
* **A**rchitecture & Technology `#a`
* **C**ulture & Team `#c`
* **T**ools of the trade `#t`

### Open Meritocracy `#c`

We will work as meritocracy, input from others, and reviewing PRs and contributing to other projects is a top priority.

### Open Source `#c`

If we don't have a good reason why something should be private, it should be public. All new repos, live on public github.

### Diversity `#c`

We are a diverse team in every respect.

### No Meetings `#t`

Get-togethers and [hackathons](./hackathons/README.md) only.

### More code, less blah, blah `#c`

Code wins. Everybody codes. Commits.

### Beautiful Creations `#p`

Well designed, beautiful output.

### Intuitive, Simple & Consistent `#p`

In that order.

### Available, Secure, Compliant  `#a` `#p` 

Always.

### Global By Design `#p`

As global as the web with regards to languages, delivery, and performance

### Latency is not an option. `#p`

Things are fast. <300ms fast. always.

### Resources and Events `#a`

Everything is a resource, every change an event. 

### APIs first `#a`

Everything has an API, REST of course.

### Serverless `#a`

period.

### Service, not Software `#a`

The software is secondary, what we build is a service

### Slack, GitHub issues, email archive `#t`

Discussions and decisions are open, asynchronous and archived.

### CI/CD `#t`

Results of commits can be seen in a production environment in 60 seconds or less.

### No False Minimum Viability `#c`

Consumer-grade quality can't allow false (non-viable) MVPs

### Closed Loop `#c`

Listen closely to customer and user feedback. Measure qualitatively and quantitatively.

### Reluctant Dictator `#c`

Whether he wants it or not, the dictator has the last word on product and architecture

### Calibrated Risk-Taking `#c`

If we don’t make a wrong decision once in six months, we are not ambitious enough. (Or self-critical)

### Get Jobs Done `#p`

The goal of the service is not to deliver features, but to get jobs done for our users and customers. 

### Enable the Marketplace `#p`

Use behance and other marketplaces to source content, design, and apps.

### Extensible Delivery `#p`

URI, CSS, Client Code, Server Code.

### Extensible Authoring `#p`

JavaScript → Native Client Code, Server Code.

### Spark `#`

Start with spark authoring experience.

### Google Docs style collaboration `#p`

See what others do right now in authoring.

### 0-60 in 1.9s `#p`

Enter your domain name, import, done.

### Parametric Design Built-In `#p`

Run your site with content variants, code variants, or configuration variants at any time  

### JavaScript and Python `#a`

On the server-side JavaScript and Python are used for the respectively intuitive payloads.

### Mobile first `#a`

Native.

### GitHub & Markdown `#a`

Anything that smells like a structured document by default stored in markdown in github

### Markdown++ `#a`

Simple formatting, powerful expressions.

### Frying Architecture `#a`

Output is assembled on request.

### Serviceful `#a`

Make maximum use of available services.

### Components & Composition `#a`

Create content, compose content, transform content, deliver content

### REST & SEO `#a`

Are King.

### Lean and Mean `#a`

Less code is better. Actively manage the dependency graph to an absolute minimum.

### Opinionated, but Open `#a`

a.k.a. polished, but tweakable.

### Content and View are Separate  `#a`

Content must not contain display logic. Display logic must not contain content. Binary content should be re-renderable.

### Local Development `#t`

Support for simple local development is imperative. Low entry barrier.

### AI/ML `#t`

Power content, workflows, designs, and operations.

### `DECISIONS.md` `#t`

Is where we document big decisions and trade-offs.

### Powerpointless `#t`

We communicate ideas through writing and status through issue trackers and automated dashboards 

### Don't let Markdown get weird `#a`

All Markdown documents should read well and logically when viewed through Github's view interface.

### Nobody designs a list view before 2022

Let's design interfaces that are bold now, we can go back to safe and boring later on.

### IE11 is not supported

We will put no effort into making our code compatible with IE.
